# Uber 2.0 clone with REACT NATIVE
  A copy of the Uber app to learn and improve coding skills with the React Native platform.

## What I have learned is how to use:

1. Tailwind CSS with RN for styling
2. React Redux for managing and centralizing application state
3. React Native Navigation to navigate between screens
4. React Native Elements as a styling library with pre-built components that build upon React Native components
5. Google Autocomplete as a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing
6. Google Directions API for real navigation
7. Google Distance Matrix API to calculate Travel time, Distance and Cost!
8. React Native Map components for iOS + Android
9. React Native Vector Icons a set of icons for buttons, logos and nav/tab bars
